## About Me
Hi, my name is C3ntr4cy, I am 15, and a hobbbyist developer, with a passion for creating interesting 
websites and applications. I have around 5 years of experience in programming with various languages, 
I have worked on a variety of projects an my skills in web design. When I'm not busy, I love to play 
all sorts of games, and work on little side projects. Some of these have been released, others will 
stay on my hard drive, never getting to see the light of day.
